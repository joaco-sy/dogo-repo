# Configuracion del repositorio 

Thereâ€™s only one rule about branches: anything in the master branch is always deployable.

Instead of working in master, changes should be merged in via Pull Requests from other feature branches or from a fork.

To this end, you should protect the master branch to encourage code reviews before changes are merged and deployed. This will prevent work from being performed directly on master, and will foster collaboration among CoA developers.

## Protecting the master branch

- settings
    - code and automation
        - branches
